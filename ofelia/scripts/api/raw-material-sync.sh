# Failure modes, all of which must fail the job:
#   - Non-200: wget itself exits non-zero, and `set -e` aborts the script.
#   - 200 whose body reports success=false (e.g. a step failed but the route
#     still answered 200): caught by the grep below.
#   - 200 with success=true but rows that failed to write: the orchestrator only
#     reports success=false when a step THROWS, so `failedWrites` is checked
#     separately.
#
# Env (set in the ofelia container, not committed):

# Fail loudly when the secret is missing. Without the :- guard an unset variable
# expands to empty and we send `x-api-key: `, which the app answers with an
# opaque 401 instead of telling us the ofelia container is misconfigured.
